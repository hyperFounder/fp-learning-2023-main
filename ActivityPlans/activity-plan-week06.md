# Activity Plan for Week 6

This week involves an anticipated time commitment of 12 total hours of structured and self-directed activity, where 3 of them are a lecture and 1 is a lab session.

## Summary

 * This week is consolidation week.  The goal is for you to revise and master all previously presented material.

## How to prepare

You must:

 1. Make sure you have done all the required reading from the previous weeks' [activity plans](../ActivityPlans/README.md).

 2. Make sure you have completed the previously assigned [problem sheets](../ProblemSheets/).

## Reading for this week

 3. Review the [lecture notes](../LectureNotes/README.md) up through the `And` type constructor in the notes for [week 5](../LectureNotes/Sections/Data1.md).

## Attend lecture

 We will use this week's lecture to prepare for the test next week.  In particular we will:

 5. Go over some strategies for submitting working code.

 6. Work through any example problems which you might find helpful.  Please come prepared with any questions which you would like to see worked out.

## Attend Lab Sessions

 7. You may use the lab sessions this week to review, work on old problem sheets, and get help with any questions you may have.

 8. If you would like additional practice either before or during the lab, you may wish to look at [99 Haskell Problems](http://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).

## Further reading

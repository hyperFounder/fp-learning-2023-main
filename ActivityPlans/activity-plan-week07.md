# Activity Plan for Week 7

This week involves an anticipated time commitment of 12 total hours of structured and self-directed activity, where 3 of them are a lecture and 1 is a lab session.

## Summary

  * The first class Test is **Thursday at 11am online**.
 
  * We will have new material in the lecture, but you are not responsible for this material in the first test.

## How to prepare

  1. Continue preparing for Test 1.  You are responsible for all of the material in the lecture notes up through the `And` type constructor in the notes for [week 5](../LectureNotes/Sections/Data1.md).

## Reading for this week

  2. Read the sections "Lists Revisited" and "Binary Trees" from [User defined data types](../LectureNotes/Sections/Data1.md) 
 
## Attend lecture

  We will discuss material related to recursive data type declarations.
  
## Attend Lab Sessions

  As with the Practice Test, there will be no official Lab on Thursday.
  
  Friday, we will have a lab session to work on the ProblemSheet for recursive data types.
